#### Engineering Experience
- **Advanced Space Technology Research and Architectures (ASTRA) Lab - Student Researcher**  
  August, 2025 - Present 
  - Built a Python-based multi-parameter model to predict neutral particle density in electrospray thruster plumes, supporting improvements in thruster performance and operational lifetime.
  - Analyzed simulation datasets in Python to characterize spatial variation in neutral particle density.
  - Generated plume visualizations in ParaView to assess simulation characteristics and select simulation parameters.

- **Cornell University Autonomous Drone Project Team - Mechanical Lead**  
  October, 2023 - Present 
  - Lead the mechanical subteam by developing project concepts, defining schedules, and mentoring new members.
  - Ran CFD simulations in ANSYS Fluent to visualize airflow around an EDF-propelled drone and its wings, using post-processing to calculate lift and drag.
  - Collaborated with mechanical, electrical, and computer science teams to prototype a large carrier drone; designed and manufactured a carbon-fiber battery mount and mounting plate in Onshape and Fusion 360.
  - Operated a CNC machine to fabricate carbon-fiber and aluminum components for multiple drone prototypes.

#### Projects
- **Load Cell Design**:  
  *FEA stress and strain load cell analysis*  
  - Performed finite element analysis in ANSYS Mechanical to evaluate the performance of a load cell and optimize its deflection and safety factors. Designed a   bridge circuit for the cell to measure strain.

- **Shoe Cleaner**:  
  *Commerical Design Project*  
  - Created and iterated CAD models in Fusion 360 for an automated shoe-cleaning device. 
  - Manufactured components with 3D printing and laser cutting; assembled the shoe cleaner with basic hand tools. 
  - Presented a final rendering package, slideshow, and report to faculty reviewers.

- **Dynamical Simulations**:  
  *Dynamical System Modeling and Simulation*  
  - Simulated dynamical systems using MATLAB’s symbolic toolbox and numerical integrators, including N-body gravitational interactions and multi-link pendulums.
