I, together with a team of fellow students, worked on designing and manufacturing a shoe cleaner in my Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Course. The purpose of this device is to brush dirt and snow off of a shoe that is covered in debris. We underwent a comprehensive design process, which began with brainstorming and ideation and concluded with a final report, presentation, and rendering package of our prototype. My primary contributions to the team were ideating, creating and iterating the CAD model after each sucessive prototype test, sourcing parts from McMaster, and assembling the final rendering package and report. One of those renderings is shown here. 

The CAD and renderings were created in Autodesk Fusion. I utilized many advanced tools that Fusion provides to create a dimensionally accurate model of the system prior to manufacture. I assembled each of our prototypes with basic hand tools. After our prototype was done, we presented a slideshow and a final report to faculty reviewers.
