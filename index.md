## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Maddox_Nesterczuk_Profile_Picture.jpeg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Maddox Nesterczuk, and I am a Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering student at Cornell University. I have a passion for spacecraft technology, autonomous vehicles, and simulation and modeling. I have experience with a variety of CAD and Simulation software, including ANSYS Mechanical, ANSYS Fluent, Fusion 360, and more, which I use to engineer mechanical and aerospace solutions from numerical models to quadcopters.

My current work in the Advanced Space Technology Research and Architectures Lab focuses on modeling the density of neutrally charged particles in the plumes of electrospray thrusters, a type of electric propulsion device for spacecraft. I also have years of experience working on a multidisciplinary autonomous drone team, on which I serve as the Mechanical Subteam lead. In this role, I help design, manufacture, and test a wide range of drone systems.

I am passionate about innovating new aerospace technologies with meaningful impacts, and I am continuing to develop my engineering skills to contribute to next-generation engineering projects.
